The actual code that starts the test, in in scala-experiments-1.jar. To be run, it needs the scala-library-2.11.5. You can launch java with the scala-lib as such:

java -cp scala-library-2.11.5.jar -jar scala-experiments-1.jar "testnavn" "MAX" "MIN" 

"MAX" and "MIN" should be integers. "testnavn" defines the name of the test, and the folder the results will be placed in.
